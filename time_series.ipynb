    "A time series is a set of data where your predicted target is affected by the passage of time. In other words, the target you're tying to predict is greatly influenced by the value of the target in the past. Many real world models require prediction based on the value of the target in past; stock value, temperature, industrial production, a person's height, weight, and age, are all examples of features whose past values greatly influence the present value.\n",
